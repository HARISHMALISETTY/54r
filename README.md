Memorypooling:-it is a concept where python trying to save memory usage by referring same object to multiple variables within limit(-5 to 256).

interning:-similar to memorypooling but applicable for short strings.

remembering something for future usage purpose in temporarly is caching.

garbage collection:identifying unused objects and throwing them into garbage is garbage collection.

we can say python is a dynamically typed language-->
there is no any restrictions while assigning values to variables in python.
so it can accept any type of value and changes its nature based on the value. so we can say python is a dynamically typed language.


data types:
-----------
what is data type?---->nothing but data. but type of the data we use.
data types are classified in python mainly two categories
1.primitive
    a.if we assign a single value to single variable then they comes under the primitive
    b.immutable
eg:int,float,string,complex,None,bool

2.non-primitive
    a.if we assign a multiple values to single variable then they comes unders the non-primitive
    b.mutable
eg:list,tuple,sets,dictionaries.

list--->collection of homogenoues/heterogenous kind of elements in order.
denotes with []
elements in the list can be mutable.

tuple--->collection of homogeneous/heterogenouos kind of elements in order
denotes with ()
elements in the tuple are immutable.

sets-->unordered collection of unique elements
denotes with {}
we can't change the specific values in sets why means they are unordered.
